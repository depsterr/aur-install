# aur-install
An extremely simple aur package installer

NOTE THAT THIS INSTALLER DOES NOT CHECK ANY SIGNATURES, AND WILL BLINDLY INSTALL ANY PACKAGE SPECIFIED

to install a package from the aur just pass the name of the package as the first argument

```
aur-install <package name>
```

# Installation

I hope that it'd be obvious to you if you're on arch, but to install this execute the following commands

```
$ git clone https://github.com/depsterr/aur-install.git
$ cd aur-install
# sh install.sh
```
